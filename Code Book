This is the Peer-Graded assignement of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.
In this assignement, I created the run_analysis.R script which performs data preparation and the 5 steps required in the course project.
 
Downloading the dataset:
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset.
Data can be downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Assigning each data to variables:
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns 
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns 
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column 
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns 
contains recorded features test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns 
contains test data of activities’code labels
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column 
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns 
contains recorded features train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns 
contains train data of activities’code labels

Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set:
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

Extracting the measurements of mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
Tidy_Data (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
Entire numbers in code column of the Tidy_Data replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the  activities variable

Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names:
code column in Tidy_Data renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject:
FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing Tidy_Data taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Exporting FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE
